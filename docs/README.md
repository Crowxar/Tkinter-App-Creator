# ✨ Tkinter App Designer

[Tkinter App Designer](https://github.com/Crowxar/Tkinter-App-Creator) is an open source project by [Crowxar](https://crowxar.github.io/). Sick and tired of repeatedly setting up the basic file structure for various Tkinter applications, I created this to streamline Tkinter application development and enhance my skills with Tkinter. This project is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License. See below for more details.

- Current Version: `v0.9.0`
- Release Date: 22 July 2024

## ✔️ Completed Features
- Creates baseline framework for tkinter apps through python. 
- Set a Title and a Path and click "Submit". The app will close and your file will be made in your directory
  - Options to allow for different sizes ( Width x Height ) format
  - Center the app on your screen
  - Lock resizeability
  - Force the app to be on top of all other windows
  - Enable the app to clear the terminal once the root window is closed (helpful for debugging)

## 📖 Usage 

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the application with `python main.py`
3. Fill out the appropriate fields and click submit. A preconfigured file should be created at your specified directory. 
4. Let me know if you run into any errors


## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Functionally the app is completed - I intend to make it look better later with tkinter designer
### 📋 In Progress

Make the App look better - possibly using tkitner designer. 

### 📅 Planned Features for the future - not in progress right now
- tkinter-designer integration for easy GUI setup

- Color Pallet Generator
    - Potential live color preview (Select a color and the app changes to see)
    - 60/30/10 color guidelines

- Add additional Size input
    - Toggleable between auto, manual sized, and default 1/2 screen size, maybe additional defaults for dropdown

- App changes
    - Save config button for entire app
    
### 💭 Potential Feature Ideas

- Widget creator - w/ methods
    - (Master should be a drop down - maybe an add new button)
    - Widget creator into text box to copy/paste
    - "Live Preview" of widget creation in real time

- Additional possible file generation / file structure
    - README, LICENSES, ect
