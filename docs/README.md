# ✨ Tkinter App Designer

[Tkinter App Designer](https://github.com/Crowxar/Tkinter-App-Creator) is an open source project by [Crowxar](https://crowxar.github.io/). Sick and tired of repeatedly setting up the basic file structure for various Tkinter applications, I created this to streamline Tkinter application development and enhance my skills with Tkinter. This project is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License. See below for more details.
