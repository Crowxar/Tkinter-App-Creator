# ‚ú® Tkinter App Designer
## Project is not in a stable spot and is currently undergoing heavy maintence!!

[Tkinter App Designer](https://github.com/Crowxar/Tkinter-App-Creator) is an open source project by [Crowxar](https://crowxar.github.io/). Sick and tired of repeatedly setting up the basic file structure for various Tkinter applications, I created this to streamline Tkinter application development and enhance my skills with Tkinter. This project is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License. See below for more details.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Completed Features
- Core documentation set up and put in place
- Basic app layout constructed
- Directory Pathing (Remembers your last path, used so you don't need to reselect every time!)
- Title error checking (making sure the file destination and name are valid)
- Customizable Size (Auto/Custom)
  - Error checking for this as well to ensure its in a "## x ##" format. 
- Errors will display on the bottom as "Invalid Path/ Invalid size/ ect
