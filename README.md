# ‚ú® Tkinter App Designer

[Tkinter App Designer](https://github.com/Crowxar/Tkinter-App-Creator) is an open source project by [Crowxar](https://crowxar.github.io/). Sick of having to type in all the basic file structure for various tkinter applications, I created this for streamlining Tkinter application developmen, as well as practice my skills with tkinter.
