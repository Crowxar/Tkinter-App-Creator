# ✨ Tkinter App Designer

[Tkinter App Designer](https://github.com/Crowxar/Tkinter-App-Creator) is an open source project by [Crowxar](https://crowxar.github.io/). Sick of having to type in all the basic file structure for various tkinter applications, I created this for streamlining Tkinter application developmen, as well as practice my skills with tkinter. 

## ✔️ Completed Features
- Core documentation set up and put in place
- Basic app layout constructed

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 📋 In Progress
- Set up initial app
  - Directory path
  - Title submit
  - Submit button

### 📅 Planned Features
- Path input with browse button
    - A way to save most recently used path to be used as default later
- Size input
    - Toggleable between auto, manual sized, and default 1/2 screen size
- Center app checkbutton

### 💭 Potential Feature Ideas
- App changes
    - Submit and close button as well
    - Resizeable toggle
    - Save config button for entire app
    - Clear terminal option
    - Force focus/top
    - Code collapsable regions
        - Imports, Functions, Setup, Data, Widgets, Events, Run
- Widget creator - w/ methods
    - (Master should be a drop down - maybe an add new button)
    - Widget creator into text box to copy/paste
    - "Live Preview" of widget creation in real time
- Color Pallet Generator
    - Potential live color preview (Select a color and the app changes to see)
    - 60/30/10 color guidelines
- Additional possible file generation / file structure
    - README, LICENSES, ect
